# Student Management System

## Overview

The Student Management System is a simple console-based C++ application that allows users to manage student records. It provides essential functionalities such as adding new students, displaying all students, searching for a student, updating student information, and deleting a student from the system.

## Features

   - Allows the user to input the roll number, name, and age of a new student.
   - Checks for duplicate entries to ensure each student is unique.

2. **Display All Students:**
   - Displays information for all students currently in the system.
   - Alerts the user if no students are found.

3. **Search Student:**
   - Searches for a student based on the provided roll number.
   - Displays detailed information if the student is found.

4. **Update Student:**
   - Updates the information of an existing student.
   - Provides options to update the roll number, name, or age.

5. **Delete Student:**
   - Removes a student from the system based on their name.

6. **Menu-Driven Interface:**
   - Presents the user with a clear menu to choose desired operations.
   - Continues running until the user decides to exit.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Code:**
   - Use a C++ compiler to build the executable file.

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the generated executable to launch the Student Management System.

3. **Follow the Menu:**
   - Choose from the available options to manage student records.

4. **Exit:**
